  # Cam Whritenour's Professional Portfolio
  This is my personal portfolio that I put together using React.  I took advantage of all of the knowledge I have learned throughout my time in the Full Stack Web Development Certification Program, to put together this project.  It came out better than I could have imagined at the start, I am particularly proud of how the home page came out. I will be continuing to update this project not only with my new projects but making some minor tweaks and continuing to polish the UI, because that is what web development is all about. A project is never trully finished, as a developer we are constantly learning new tips and tricks to make our applications look and run better.
